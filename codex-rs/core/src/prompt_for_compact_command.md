• High-level objective or problem being solved  
• Key instructions or design decisions given by the user  
• Main security actions or recommendations from the AI
• Important files, processes, or artifacts discussed
• Any unresolved questions or next steps

Produce the summary in a structured format like:

**Objective:** …

**User instructions:** … (bulleted)

**AI actions / security behavior:** … (bulleted)

**Important entities:** … (e.g. file names, processes, artifacts)

**Open issues / next steps:** … (if any)

**Summary (concise):** (one or two sentences)
